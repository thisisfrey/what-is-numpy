## Installation & Usage

To use NumPy in your Python projects, you can install it using the following pip command:

```console
pip install numpy
```

After installing NumPy, you can import it in your Python code using the following import statement:

```python
import numpy as np
```

Once imported, you can start utilizing NumPy's powerful features for numerical computations, including creating arrays,
performing mathematical operations, and much more.

For more information and detailed usage examples, please refer to the [official NumPy
documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) .
